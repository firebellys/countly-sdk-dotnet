##What's Countly?

[Countly](http://count.ly) is an innovative, real-time, open source mobile analytics and push notifications application. It collects data from mobile devices, and visualizes this information to analyze mobile application usage and end-user behavior. There are two parts of Countly: the server that collects and analyzes data, and mobile SDK that sends this data. Both parts are open source with different licensing terms.
